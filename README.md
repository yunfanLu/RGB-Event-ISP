# RGB-Event ISP: MATLAB Implementation

## Overview of ISP
This repository contains the **MATLAB** implementation of the **RGB-Event ISP** pipeline, which processes RAW images into color-corrected RGB images. The codebase is developed as part of the **RGB-Event ISP Dataset and Benchmark**, which introduces the first event-RAW paired dataset for event-based image signal processing (ISP). The dataset and associated methods were presented in our ICLR 2025 paper.

The RGB-Event ISP Benchmark dataset can be accessed via the following link:

Please note that use of this dataset is strictly limited to non-commercial academic research. By downloading or using the dataset, you agree to comply with the terms specified in the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/yunfanLu/RGB-Event-ISP/blob/main/LICENSE.pdf).

### PyTorch Implementation
For the ‌Benchmark‌ implementation in ‌**PyTorch‌**, please refer to the dedicated repository [github.com/yunfanLu/RGB-Event-ISP-Benchmark](https://github.com/yunfanLu/RGB-Event-ISP-Benchmark).

## Features
- **RAW Image Processing**: Converts APS RAW images into RGB images using a predefined ISP pipeline.
- **Controllable ISP Pipeline**: Implements black level correction, demosaicing, white balancing, denoising, and color correction.
- **MATLAB-Based Processing**: Provides a structured and modular ISP framework for MATLAB users.
- **Dataset and Evaluation**: Supports the new RGB-Event ISP dataset with diverse scenes, lighting conditions, and event-RAW alignment.

**Note**: The ISP process described in our paper uses a ColorChecker as a prior for color correction and does not incorporate event data for RAW to RGB conversion.
